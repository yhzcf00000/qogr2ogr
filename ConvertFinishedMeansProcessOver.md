#The message box "Convert finished" means nothing but process is over


# Details #
When the convert process is over, there will be a message box. it tell you covert finished, but it won't tell you if there is any wrong in the process. If the destination data doesn't appear, you should check out if the source data is okey, or you should mail to me because maybe it is a bug.
